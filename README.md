# Tuition Centre Management Information System (CLI-Based)

## 📘 Introduction

In this era of rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting digital solutions to streamline operations and handle Big Data for informed decision-making. Brillian Tuition Centre faced challenges in managing large volumes of student and staff information, resulting in significant time and cost consumption.

To address this, our team developed a **Tuition Centre Management Information System**, a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to offer a cost-effective and user-friendly platform for students, tutors, receptionists, and administrators to interact with the tuition centre efficiently.

This project was developed as part of our **Diploma in Information Technology (Year 2, Semester 3)** coursework, demonstrating fundamental Python programming concepts in a real-world case study.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Digitize and centralize data management for a tuition centre.
- Provide different system functionalities tailored to user roles.
- Design a menu-driven CLI interface accessible even to users with minimal IT background.
